# Bootstrap-portfolio
Portfolio of my work using the Bootstrap CSS Framework

## Description
This project is a website to show my portfolio of work. The project was built to become familiar with bootstrap, as well as to demonstrate my web development journey and university research to future emplyees. During the course of this project the use of bootstrap features including cards, carousels and navigation bars were understood in order to develop an interactive and responsive portfolio design.
